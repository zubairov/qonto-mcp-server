> [!IMPORTANT]
> Security and customer trust are fundamental to everything we do at Qonto. While this repository enables powerful innovation and integration capabilities, it's important to understand that certain risks are inherent to the use of the MCP technology itself. Please review the following security information carefully.


## ⚠️🔒 SECURITY NOTICE

The [MCP (Model Context Provider)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) protocol gives AI models access to additional functionality like reading files, accessing APIs, and generate responses based on contextual data.

While this brings powerful integration capabilities, it also introduces important security considerations.

**A malicious MCP server can secretly steal credentials and maliciously exploit other trusted MCP servers you're using** ([read more](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/9/mcp-prompt-injection/)).

These risks are not specific to Qonto’s MCP server, but apply to any use of the MCP protocol.

We recommend to only use MCP servers you trust, just as you would with any software you install on your computer.

Questions or security concerns? Contact us at `security@qonto.com`.

## Getting started

1. Install [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)
2. Get your organization ID and API key from your Qonto account's `/settings/integrations` section:

### Option 1: Docker Installation (Recommended)

1. Pull the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker pull qonto/qonto-mcp-server:latest
   ```
2. In your Claude Desktop `claude_desktop_config.json` file, add the `Qonto MCP` server as follows:

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Qonto MCP Docker": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "-e", "QONTO_API_KEY=<QONTO_API_KEY>",                 // <- change this with the API key from the settings page
        "-e", "QONTO_ORGANIZATION_ID=<QONTO_ORGANIZATION_ID>", // <- change this with the organization id from the settings page
        "-e", "QONTO_THIRDPARTY_HOST=https://thirdparty.qonto.com",
        "qonto/qonto-mcp-server:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

For example, this is a full Docker configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Qonto MCP Docker": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "-e", "QONTO_API_KEY=abcdefghihlmnopqrstuvxz123456",
        "-e", "QONTO_ORGANIZATION_ID=qonto-organization-slug-1234",
        "-e", "QONTO_THIRDPARTY_HOST=https://thirdparty.qonto.com",
        "qonto/qonto-mcp-server:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

<summary>Option 2: Local Installation</summary>

1. Clone this repository locally
2. Install [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/). If you're on Mac, you can just do `brew install uv`
3. In your Claude Desktop `claude_desktop_config.json` file, add the `Qonto MCP` server as follows:

> **Note**: You can optionally pass `--transport streamable-http` to use HTTP transport instead of the default `stdio` transport protocol. 

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Qonto MCP": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--with",
        "mcp[cli]",
        "--with",
        "requests",
        "mcp",
        "run",
        "<PATH_TO_CLONED_REPO_FOLDER, ie. ~/development/qonto-mcp/qonto_mcp/server.py>", // <- change this
        "--transport",
        "stdio"  // <- optional: change to "streamable-http" for HTTP transport
      ],
      "env": {
        "QONTO_API_KEY": "<QONTO_API_KEY>",                 // <- change this with the API key from the settings page
        "QONTO_ORGANIZATION_ID": "<QONTO_ORGANIZATION_ID>", // <- change this with the organization id from the settings page
        "QONTO_THIRDPARTY_HOST": "https://thirdparty.qonto.com",
        "PYTHONPATH": "<PATH_TO_CLONED_REPO, ie. ~/development/qonto-mcp>" // <- change this
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For example, this is a full configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Qonto MCP": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--with",
        "mcp[cli]",
        "--with",
        "requests",
        "mcp",
        "run",
        "~/development/qonto-mcp/qonto_mcp/server.py",
        "--transport",
        "stdio"
      ],
      "env": {
        "QONTO_API_KEY": "abcdefghihlmnopqrstuvxz123456",
        "QONTO_ORGANIZATION_ID": "qonto-organization-slug-1234",
        "QONTO_THIRDPARTY_HOST": "https://thirdparty.qonto.com",
        "PYTHONPATH": "~/development/qonto-mcp"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Available Tools

This MCP server provides the following tools for interacting with your Qonto account:

- **Organization Info**: Get details about your Qonto organization
- **Account Management**: Access account information and balances
- **Transaction History**: Retrieve and analyze transaction data
- **Business Operations**: Access business-related financial data
- **Transfer preparation**: Pre-configure transfer templates that land as
  `pending` requests for manual approval inside the Qonto app — money only
  moves once a teammate with review permissions approves. Tools:
  - `create_qonto_multi_transfer_request` — draft 1–400 transfers in one
    request awaiting human approval.
  - `create_qonto_sepa_beneficiary`, `update_qonto_sepa_beneficiary`,
    `trust_qonto_sepa_beneficiaries` — manage the beneficiary address book.
    (`trust` is Embed-partner only and may return 403 on standard API keys.)
  - `verify_qonto_sepa_payee`, `bulk_verify_qonto_sepa_payees` —
    Verification of Payee (VoP) checks before drafting a transfer.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `QONTO_API_KEY`: Your Qonto API key (required)
- `QONTO_ORGANIZATION_ID`: Your organization ID (required)  
- `QONTO_THIRDPARTY_HOST`: API host URL (defaults to https://thirdparty.qonto.com)

### Transport Options

The server supports both `stdio` and `streamable-http` transport protocols. Use `stdio` for most cases, or `streamable-http` if you need HTTP-based communication.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Invalid API credentials**: Ensure your API key and organization ID are correct
2. **Connection timeout**: Check your network connection and API host URL
3. **Claude Desktop not recognizing the server**: Restart Claude Desktop after configuration changes
