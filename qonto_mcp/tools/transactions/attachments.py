    """
    Uploads a file and attaches it to a Qonto transaction.

    Two input modes — provide exactly one of `file_path` or `file_content_base64`:

      1. file_path: path that the MCP server process can read.
         When the server runs in Docker, this must be a path INSIDE the
         container. Mount your host directory at run time, e.g.:
             docker run -v /Users/alice/receipts:/files:ro qonto-mcp-server
         and pass `file_path='/files/lunch.pdf'`.

      2. file_content_base64 + filename: base64-encoded bytes plus the original
         filename. Use this when the server has no shared filesystem with the
         client (Docker without a mount, remote server, etc.). `mime_type` is
         optional and inferred from `filename` if omitted. Soft size cap is
         ~25 MB encoded (≈18 MB raw); Qonto rejects raw files over 15 MB.

    Accepted file formats: JPEG, PNG, PDF.
    The attachment is processed asynchronously — it may not appear immediately
    when listing attachments.

    Args:
        transaction_id: UUID of the transaction to attach the file to
        file_path: Server-side path to the file (mutually exclusive with
            file_content_base64)
        file_content_base64: Base64-encoded file bytes (mutually exclusive
            with file_path)
        filename: Original filename — required when using file_content_base64;
            ignored when using file_path
        mime_type: Optional MIME-type override; inferred from the filename
            when absent
